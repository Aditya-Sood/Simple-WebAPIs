1) PROJECT GOAL:
-> Provide the user two simple forms: 
	1) For entering person details, and
	2) For requesting generation of PDF of visiting cards.

-> Output is in PDF form for correct input, and a redirecting page otherwise.
#####



#####
2) DETAILS $ INSTRUCTIONS:
* This project is a mix of HTML and PhP

* An HTML form is provided to the user for entering the data and selecting the various operations to be performed.

* A PhP script processes the input of the user.
	-> Once the input is validated, the required output is displayed as a PDF.
	-> Otherwise, for erroneous input, a webpage specifying the errors and a redirecting button is displayed.

* This project uses an external library: FPDF Library (http://www.fpdf.org/)
	-> Used for displaying the processed output as a PDF
	-> Manual for the library: (http://www.fpdf.org/en/doc/index.php)
	-> The 'fpdf.php' file and 'font' folder must be saved at (\xampp\php\pear) for the library to work.

* The project consists of four files:
	i) 	myform.html - The HTML form displayed for taking user input of details.
	ii)	myproc.php - The PhP file for validating and processing the form input of details.
	iii)print.html - The HTML form displayed for requesting generation of visiting cards PDF.
	iv) printproc.php - The PhP file for generation of visiting cards PDF.

* All files which are part of the project must be saved at (\xampp\htdocs) to be accessible on the server.

3) CODE WORKFLOW:
* The project files ('myform.html', 'processor.php', 'print.html' & 'printproc.php') have been completely documented
	-> Use of each portion of the code is explained along side as comments
	-> Workflow explained in the comments

* PDF Output is independent of the the class representing the user input form
	-> Code is modular for displaying output in Excel form if the need be, by replacing the relevant code OUTSIDE the class.
#####



#####
4) FAQ:
* The most frequent error which may be encountered is: "FPDF error: Some data has already been output, can't send PDF"
	-> It occurs whenever some output (through echo or print functions) has been sent in the program before.
	-> When a PDF file is to be sent, then NO OUTPUT CAN BE SENT OTHER THAN THE PDF FILE for the entire program's duration.
	-> Check for an unintentional call to echo or print function in the program.

* The PDO object requires correct login details for execution of SQL statements and queries. Failure to do so will lead to ignored requests to the database.
