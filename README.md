# Simple-WebAPIs
Two elementary Web APIs, both using a PhP web-server for processing requests and an HTML form to interact with the same.

The second example also uses a MySQL database to store data, received by the web-server from the front-end form, and retrieve the same for creating a PDF of the data.
